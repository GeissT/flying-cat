Project Flying Cat
==================

A modular, lua-based operating system project.

By [Turbsen](http://turbsen.info "Go to website for Turbsen")

## Building Flying Cat
The following software is required to successfully build Flying Cat:

* [NASM](http://www.nasm.us/) (Assembler)
* [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/) (C compiler)
* LD
* [mkfs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mkfs) (creates filesystem)
* mkfs.vfat (fat for mkfs)
* [GRUB](http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/) (bootloader)
* sudo (the build script can be edited to remove the sudo dependency, however it then must be run as root)

Additionally, your system must support loopback devices and some parts of the `build.sh` build script require superuser privileges.

## Running Flying Cat
Flying Cat is built as a floppy disk image which can be run in a Virtual Machine, or written to a physical floppy disk to be booted from.

Naturally, any VM software should be able to run Flying Cat, although the included `run.sh` script is designed for [QEMU](http://qemu.org "Go to website for Qemu to download it").

You should be able to get a boot going in QEMU by simply running:
> $ ./run.sh

Otherwise you want to run `build.sh` and manually mount the image in VM of choice, other Virtual Machines include [Virtualbox](http://virtualbox.org) and [VMWare](http://vmware.com), note however that Flying Cat have *not* been tested in these.

Should you be unable to compile it yourself, you can use the precompiled `floppy.img` included in the source, note however, that this might not be the most recent build.
